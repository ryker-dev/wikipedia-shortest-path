# wikipedia-shortest-path
This project was made for a university course.

## Minimal requirements
-   Do NOT parse Wikipedia through HTML. Use the Wikipedia API. This is a request made by Wikipedia.
-   List ALL sources which you have copy-pasted code from. Using other people's code for parts of the solution is fine, as long as you mark it clearly in your codebase.
-   Any parts of the report that are over the maximum limits will not be graded. The maximum length for the report is 6 pages and for the video 15 minutes.

## Basic technical requirements
A main worker unit that:
-   Keeps a track of all child-workers
-   Communicates between the children in order to determine their status
-   Makes sure the system works properly
 
A fixed amount of child units:
-   Synchronous & Concurrent execution
-   Parse Wikipedia information
